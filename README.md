# Bussniess model & Marketing 

### Business Overview
Easy Keyboard Maker is a thriving **B2C e-commerce** platform with a mission to provide high-quality keyboard-related products to our valued customers through our online store. Product range includes keyboards, mechanical keyboards, and essential keyboard accessories.

#### Key Advantages for the Business:
1. **Scalability:** Business can grow seamlessly as our customer base expands.
2. **Online Presence:** Saving on physical locations, focusing resources on product quality and customer satisfaction.
3. **Global Reach:** Can reach customers worldwide, eliminating geographical restrictions.
4. **Niche Focus:** Cater to keyboard enthusiasts, building a brand that resonates with our audience.
5. **Cost-Efficiency:** Low startup costs allow us to allocate a significant budget for customer acquisition and marketing.
6. **Impulse Buying:** Competitive pricing encourages spontaneous purchases from customers exploring keyboard options.


#### Challenges to Address:
1. **Getting Customers:** It may be hard to attract customers in a crowded market. Effective marketing strategies are essential.
2. **Building a Brand:** Creating a brand from scratch takes time. Immediate success requires a well-planned marketing strategy.
3. **Marketing Efforts:** Attracting organic customers takes time. We'll need to actively promote our business and consider paid advertising.
4. **Building Trust:** Operating online can make it harder to build trust and loyalty. Offering discounts and promotions may help.
5. **Order Volume:** Due to competitive pricing, we need a reasonable number of orders to ensure business viability.


#### Subscription Model Consideration
Considering the pros and cons of our business model, implementing a subscription-based approach may not be viable initially. Such a model requires an established customer base and some degree of brand loyalty, which may take time to cultivate.

#### Preferred Approach
Primary strategy is to offer products in a traditional pay-as-you-go e-commerce format. As our business grows and customer loyalty deepens, the implementation of a subscription model may become a more viable option in the future. This approach ensures our immediate success while allowing flexibility for future expansion.

### Site User
- **User 1:** The typical site user for Easy Keyboard Maker would be an individual, male and female, aged between 18 and 50. They have a strong interest in computer IT, gaming, and customizing their keyboard setups. They may range from beginners to advanced users, including gamers, programmers, and professionals looking for ergonomic solutions.

- **User 2:** In addition to the primary site users, we also consider partners and gift shoppers. These individuals may visit our site to explore gift options for the keyboard enthusiasts in their lives. They could be of any gender and age, looking for thoughtful and unique presents, such as customized keycaps or accessories, to surprise and delight the keyboard enthusiasts they know.

- **User 3:** Represents individuals who are deeply immersed in Asian culture, particularly those who have a strong affinity for anime. There is a significant overlap between anime culture and keyboard customization in Asia, making it a promising target audience. By offering unique keycaps and keyboard customization options that resonate with anime themes.


### Goals for the Website
- Create a user-friendly website with a clear purpose.
- Provide products that meet user expectations.
- Enable users to access, read, and engage with informative articles.
- Offer insights and tips on keyboard care to build trust and loyalty.
- Allow users to checkout quickly and easily.
- Allow users to create profiles for order history and profile updates.


### Marketing Strategy
The business's marketing strateg2y for the future includes the following elements:

1. Utilizing the company's Social media pages for store promotion and building community.

2. Sharing the page with friends and family and encouraging them to like and share it within their extended network.

3. Organizing a soft online launch sale to stimulate early adoption and attract potential clients for initial purchases.

4. Building a subscriber base through the Mailchimp option on the website and subsequently sending out special offers and promotions to foster customer loyalty.

5. Crafting informative and valuable articles and blog posts to enhance the store's SEO ranking on search engines like Google.

6. Exploring the possibility of using paid advertising channels such as Google Ads and other social Ads to target the desired demographic.

7. Creating multiple ads with distinct product cover images, monitoring the click-through rates, and focusing on the most successful ones.

8. Depending on the available budget, the business may consider collaborating with influencers in its niche to promote custom-made products. This could involve providing complimentary items or a modest fee in exchange for a shout-out or product review. The target influencers would ideally have a following of at least 10,000 in the relevant niche, which is feasible even for a business with limited initial funding and can help drive traffic to the website.


#### Social Media
Easy Keyboard Maker E-Commerce will primarily utilize social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok for promotion. Additionally, we will establish and operate a Discord Server and live stream on our Twitch channel for content and interactive sessions. There is also a possibility of creating a YouTube channel to compile all the highlights in the future.

Our social media links and e-commerce webshop were combined on a single page to enhance navigation and foster a sense of community. You can access all our social links through our main link, which is managed using [LINKTR](https://linktr.ee/).

#### Customer Engagement Strategy: Social Media Contests and Giveaways
Regular social media contests and giveaways on our platforms. These contests will feature enticing prizes, such as free keyboards and accessories, to create excitement and attract potential customers.

To participate, individuals will be required to complete simple actions, including liking our posts, sharing content, tagging friends, or leaving comments. These activities not only foster engagement but also increase brand visibility as participants interact with our content.

This is to build a sense of community among keyboard enthusiasts, where participants engage not only with our brand but with each other. This approach fosters brand loyalty and extends beyond the giveaways.

Additionally, reward our most active and engaged customers with exclusive discounts or opportunities.

Success in this strategy will be measured through engagement rates, new followers, and customer conversion data, guiding our ongoing social media efforts.


### SEO Search Engine Optimization
By optimizing the e-commerce for search engines, it will increase and reach the right audience, build trust, and stay competitive in the market. SEO is our cost-effective strategy for enhancing user experience and attracting both local and global customers.

#### SEO Project planning
After finalizing the business model for keyboard selling in the e-commerce sector, I began the process of strategizing how to market the website and identify target keywords. I leveraged Google Trends to uncover popular search terms and employed a tool named SEO quake to assess the competition and learn from their successful tactics. Additionally, I conducted keyword research on wordtracker.com by signing up for a trial to maximize its benefits. This comprehensive approach led to the compilation of a list of both short and long-tail keywords intended for use in this project.

#### Keywords 
By strategically leveraging short-tail keywords and conducting in-depth analysis through [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) and [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/?fpr=huynh60), related questions, I've curated a powerful list of long-tail keywords tailored to our niche. These carefully chosen keywords are strategically placed across various sections of the website to enhance visibility and attract a specific audience interested in our unique keyboard and keycap offerings.

#### Short-Tail Keywords:
1. Mechanical Keyboards
2. Keycaps
3. Wireless Keyboards
4. Gaming Keyboards
5. Custom Keycaps
6. Keyboard Accessories

#### Long-Tail Keywords:
1. Quality Mechanical Keyboards
2. Affordable Keycaps for Sale
3. Limited Edition Keyboards
4. Custom Keycap Retailer
5. Personalized Mechanical Keyboards
6. Wireless Gaming Keyboards
7. Unique Keyboard Accessories
8. Best Custom Keycap Maker
9. Exclusive Limited Edition Keyboards
10. Top-rated Mechanical Keyboards Shop


#### Implementation:
By taking advantage of this keyword, i have implemented this keywords in different ways in my ecommerce site. This will also continuing to be implemented as long the site are live.

Content Integration:
   - Integrate long-tail keywords into product descriptions, blog posts, and other content sections. Ensure a natural flow of language while highlighting the unique features of each product.

Meta Tags and Descriptions:
   - Incorporate long-tail keywords into meta tags, meta descriptions, and image alt text. This enhances the search engine optimization (SEO) and improves its ranking for relevant search queries.

Header Tags (H1, H2, H3):
   - Utilize header tags to structure the content. Long-tail keywords in H1 tags for main headings and H2, H3 tags for subheadings.

Strong Tags (Strong Emphasis):
   - Apply the `<strong>` HTML tag to emphasize important keywords or phrases. This helps search engines understand the significance of those terms within your content.

Link Descriptions:
   - Ensure that all internal and external links are appropriately described. Use relevant anchor text that incorporates long-tail keyword.

Alt Text for Images:
   - When using images, include descriptive alt text that features long-tail keywords.


#### Sitemap.xml
I created a sitemap for the website to ensure effective searchability by search engines like Google once it is live. Implemented and generated the xml file from [Xml Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).

#### Robots.txt
I generated a `robots.txt` file to facilitate Google's crawling of the site. I excluded the accounts app and checkout payment app from being crawled as it doesn't provide any significant benefit for Google to index those pages.

#### Logo
The favicon and social media logo were crafted using Photoshop and Adobe.

The logo was conceptualized with a keyboard theme in mind, symbolizing the company's focus on keyboards. A catchy word break was implemented for better readability due to the company's lengthy name.

This logo is prominently featured on all social media platforms and e-commerce sites.

# Methodology

The EasyKeyboardMaker project follows a methodology inspired by AGILE principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution.

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Iterative Development Approach
The EasyKeyboardMaker project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

To ensure efficient prioritization, our project employs the MuSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method. User stories critical to the app's success are categorized as Must-haves, followed by Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. You can refer to our [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/KimBergstroem/projects/10) to view the prioritization.

Within each sprint, a MoSCoW method is used to further prioritize user stories. They are classified as Must Do, Should Do, Could Do, and Won't Do, representing the remaining user stories that will not be included in the sprints. This approach ensures a clear differentiation between our overall project prioritization and the prioritization within each sprint, minimizing any potential confusion.

**Labels and User Story Distribution (MoSCoW):**

- **Must-Have:** 22/38
- **Should-Have:** 7/38
- **Could-Have:** 5/38
- **Wont-Have:** 4/38
- **Task:** 4
- **Documentation:** 2

# Database
When creating the database structure schema for this project, I utilized the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool allowed me to visually design and document the database schema, making it easier to plan and implement the database for the e-commerce application.

<center> 

![Database Schema image](/docs/readme.md/readme-database_schema.png) 

</center>

I utilized the terminal command `python manage.py inspectdb > models.py` to generate all the models in my code. Subsequently, I manually selected and removed Django's built-in models as well as those from the Allauth package.

# Design UI
This E-commerce project embraces a light theme, a user-centric platform where products take center stage. With a focus on professionalism and user engagement, the design thinking revolves around the harmonious use of color, the strategic allocation of visual elements, and the integration of purple and blue accents to enhance interactivity and capture users attention.

### Design Choices
Design choices were thoughtfully curated to resonate with professionals, developers, work enthusiasts, and keyboard aficionados. Crafted an environment that exudes professionalism and caters to the diverse interests of our audience.

### Main Colors
Decision to adopt the 60-30-10 rule in our UI design is driven by its ability to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. This approach guarantees consistency by allocating 60% of our color palette to the dominant color, fostering brand recognition and trust. The 30% dedicated to the secondary color enables a visual balance, allowing for variations in content, headers, and backgrounds without overwhelming users. The remaining 10% allocated to the accent color serves to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. This strategy ensures that the web application not only looks appealing but also functions effectively, guiding users to key elements while maintaining a harmonious and dependable design.

![Color Palette image](/docs/readme.md/ui/readme-color-palette.png)

**Dominant (60%):** 

Our dominant color, which makes up 60% of our color palette, is a subtle departure from pure white. It features a hint of gray to enhance its visual appeal, contributing to a more captivating and elegant appearance. This nuanced modification to the dominant color elevates the user experience and contributes to a light and inviting theme.

**Secondary (30%):** 

The secondary color, comprising 30% of our color palette, is characterized by its vibrant and distinctive shade of deep lavender (#8739F9). This color serves as a key supporting element in our design, offering a balanced and visually engaging backdrop for content, headers, and backgrounds. Its presence complements the dominant color and allows for creative variations while maintaining a cohesive and user-friendly aesthetic.

**Accent (10%):** 

Our accent color, accounting for the remaining 10% of our color palette, is a lively and captivating shade of bright cyan (#37B9F1). This bold color is strategically employed to accentuate interactive elements and calls to action throughout the web application, enhancing user engagement and guiding users to key features.

**Text colors:**

![Font color image](/docs/readme.md/ui/readme-color-text.png)

### Fonts

**Lato (Headers):**

![Font color image](/docs/readme.md/ui/readme-text-lato.png)

Lato as the primary font for headers, titles, and navigation elements in our e-commerce project. This modern and elegant sans-serif font offers versatility and a clean design, making it an ideal choice for highlighting essential information. Lato not only exudes professionalism but also adds a touch of style to our website's visual identity.

**Poppins (Text Paragraphs):**

![Font color image](/docs/readme.md/ui/readme-text-poppins.png)

For text paragraphs, product descriptions, and other textual content, we've opted for Poppins. This sans-serif font is recognized for its exceptional readability and clarity, ensuring that our textual content is easily legible and visually engaging. Poppins contributes to a clean and modern appearance that aligns perfectly with our commitment to providing a seamless user experience.

### Known bugs

| **Bug** | **Description** |
| ------- | --------------- |
| [Internal Server 500 Error on Subscription Module in Deployed Environment ](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/60) | This issue persists. |
| [When the ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION setting is set to 'mandatory' in my Django application, the login system breaks. Attempting to sign up or log in new users results in a server error 500.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/57) | This issue persists. |
| [Clicking the "remove" button in the shopping bag for an item, it's triggers an unnecessary toast success pop-up window, even when already on the shopping bag page. This behavior can be confusing for users, as this pop-up is showing the updated bag items and everything, when user already are in the shopping bag page.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/55) | This issue is still unresolved. |
| [Implementing a MultipleChoiceField for small images in the product form did not behave as expected. The field did not display the small images properly, and attempts to allow superusers to edit, delete, or add new small images during product editing were unsuccessful.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/58) | This issue persists, but workaround is implemented. |


### Fixed bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| [Minus button in the shopping bag to be disabled when the quantity is 1. It works on mobile but not on desktop. The issue is that the page shows two minus buttons with the same ID. One is hidden depending on the screen size. This makes the minus button not disabled and users can click minus -1 -2 -3 -4 without any changes to the shopping bag.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/53) | The bug was addressed by ensuring unique identifiers for each minus button in the shopping bag. |
| [When attempting to add a product without an image to the shopping bag, an error occurs. The specific error message displayed is "ValueError at /products/175/". The 'image' attribute has no file associated with it.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/54) | Added an If statement to check the condition, `{% if item.product.image %}<img src="{{ item.product.image.url }}" alt="{{ item.product.name}}" class="w-100">{% else %}<img class="w-100" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}noimage.png" alt="{{ item.product.name}}">{% endif %}` |
| [In the mobile-friendly view (lowest 320px X 640px), the icons in the navbar collapse, resulting in a user-unfriendly experience. The navbar icons split into two rows, obscuring the content below as it gets hidden under the second row.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/56) | Used media queries to ensure that, on smaller mobile screens such as 340px wide, the navbar doesn't collapse and is presented correctly. Targeted classes `as .nav-link , .nav-link i.fa-lg and .navbar-toggler` |
| [Page not found (404). If administrator deletes a product from the inventory and users with this product still in their bag may encounter an error that disrupts the entire application.](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5/issues/59) | Removed `get_object_or_404` handling and added a `TRY` and `EXCEPT` BLOCK instead, and no longer relying on that 404 for if product exists. |

# Deployment

### App Deployment
For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:**
   - Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Custom Domain configuration

1. **Register Domain:**
   - Register a domain with a domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).

2. **Add Custom Domain in Heroku:**
   - Go to the "Settings" tab of your Heroku app.
   - Scroll down to "Domains" and click "Add Domain."
   - Enter your custom domain (e.g., `www.easykeyboardsmaker.com`).
   - Copy the provided DNS target. It will look something like `shallow-atoll-32t56jvds3s5fhf8767d9a9c.herokudns.com`.

3. **Configure DNS Records:**
   - Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).
   - Navigate to DNS settings.
   - Add a CNAME record:
      - Type: CNAME
      - Name: www
      - Value: Paste Heroku's DNS target
      - TTL: Set to default

4. **Verify Domain Configuration:**
   - Check the "Domains" section in your Heroku dashboard.
   - Wait for DNS changes to propagate (up to 48 hours).

5. **HTTP and HTTPS Forwarding (Optional):**
   - Optionally, configure forwarding in your domain registrar's settings.

6. **Verify Custom Domain:**
   - After DNS propagation, access your app using the custom domain.

6. **Add ACCESS_HOSTNAME to your project settings:**
