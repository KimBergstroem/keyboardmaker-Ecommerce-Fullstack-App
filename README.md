### Goals for the website
- Example

### Marketing Strategy
The business's marketing strategy for the future includes the following elements:

1. Utilizing the company's Social media pages for store promotion and building community.

2. Sharing the page with friends and family and encouraging them to like and share it within their extended network.

3. Organizing a soft online launch sale to stimulate early adoption and attract potential clients for initial purchases.

4. Building a subscriber base through the Mailchimp option on the website and subsequently sending out special offers and promotions to foster customer loyalty.

5. Crafting informative and valuable articles and blog posts to enhance the store's SEO ranking on search engines like Google.

6. Exploring the possibility of using paid advertising channels such as Google Ads and other social Ads to target the desired demographic.

7. Creating multiple ads with distinct product cover images, monitoring the click-through rates, and focusing on the most successful ones.

8. Depending on the available budget, the business may consider collaborating with influencers in its niche to promote custom-made products. This could involve providing complimentary items or a modest fee in exchange for a shout-out or product review. The target influencers would ideally have a following of at least 10,000 in the relevant niche, which is feasible even for a business with limited initial funding and can help drive traffic to the website.


#### Social Media
Easy Keyboard Maker E-Commerce will primarily utilize social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok for promotion. Additionally, we will establish and operate a Discord Server and live stream on our Twitch channel for content and interactive sessions. There is also a possibility of creating a YouTube channel to compile all the highlights in the future.

Our social media links and e-commerce webshop were combined on a single page to enhance navigation and foster a sense of community. You can access all our social links through our main link, [EasyKeyboardMaker](https://linktr.ee/easykeyboardmaker), which is managed using LINKTR. Below, you can find images of every page for documentation purposes.

### SEO Search Engine Optimization
By optimizing the e-commerce for search engines, it will increase and reach the right audience, build trust, and stay competitive in the market. SEO is our cost-effective strategy for enhancing user experience and attracting both local and global customers.

#### SEO Project planning
After finalizing the business model for keyboard selling in the e-commerce sector, I began the process of strategizing how to market the website and identify target keywords. I leveraged Google Trends to uncover popular search terms and employed a tool named SEO quake to assess the competition and learn from their successful tactics. Additionally, I conducted keyword research on wordtracker.com by signing up for a trial to maximize its benefits. This comprehensive approach led to the compilation of a list of both short and long-tail keywords intended for use in this project.

# Methodology

The EasyKeyboardMaker project follows a methodology inspired by AGILE principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution.

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Iterative Development Approach
The EasyKeyboardMaker project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

To ensure efficient prioritization, our project employs the MuSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method. User stories critical to the app's success are categorized as Must-haves, followed by Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. You can refer to our [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/KimBergstroem/projects/10) to view the prioritization.

Within each sprint, a MoSCoW method is used to further prioritize user stories. They are classified as Must Do, Should Do, Could Do, and Won't Do, representing the remaining user stories that will not be included in the sprints. This approach ensures a clear differentiation between our overall project prioritization and the prioritization within each sprint, minimizing any potential confusion.

**Labels and User Story Distribution (MoSCoW):**

- **Must-Have:** 22/38
- **Should-Have:** 7/38
- **Could-Have:** 5/38
- **Wont-Have:** 4/38
- **Task:** 4
- **Documentation:** 2

# Database
When creating the database structure schema for this project, I utilized the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool allowed me to visually design and document the database schema, making it easier to plan and implement the database for the e-commerce application.

# Design UI
This E-commerce project embraces a light theme, a user-centric platform where products take center stage. With a focus on professionalism and user engagement, the design thinking revolves around the harmonious use of color, the strategic allocation of visual elements, and the integration of purple and blue accents to enhance interactivity and capture users attention.

### Design Choices
Design choices were thoughtfully curated to resonate with professionals, developers, work enthusiasts, and keyboard aficionados. Crafted an environment that exudes professionalism and caters to the diverse interests of our audience.

### Main Colors
Decision to adopt the 60-30-10 rule in our UI design is driven by its ability to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. This approach guarantees consistency by allocating 60% of our color palette to the dominant color, fostering brand recognition and trust. The 30% dedicated to the secondary color enables a visual balance, allowing for variations in content, headers, and backgrounds without overwhelming users. The remaining 10% allocated to the accent color serves to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. This strategy ensures that the web application not only looks appealing but also functions effectively, guiding users to key elements while maintaining a harmonious and dependable design.

![Color Palette image](/docs/readme.md/readme-color-palette.png)

**Dominant (60%):** 

Our dominant color, which makes up 60% of our color palette, is a subtle departure from pure white. It features a hint of gray to enhance its visual appeal, contributing to a more captivating and elegant appearance. This nuanced modification to the dominant color elevates the user experience and contributes to a light and inviting theme.

**Secondary (30%):** 

The secondary color, comprising 30% of our color palette, is characterized by its vibrant and distinctive shade of deep lavender (#8739F9). This color serves as a key supporting element in our design, offering a balanced and visually engaging backdrop for content, headers, and backgrounds. Its presence complements the dominant color and allows for creative variations while maintaining a cohesive and user-friendly aesthetic.

**Accent (10%):** 

Our accent color, accounting for the remaining 10% of our color palette, is a lively and captivating shade of bright cyan (#37B9F1). This bold color is strategically employed to accentuate interactive elements and calls to action throughout the web application, enhancing user engagement and guiding users to key features.

**Text colors:**
![Font color image](/docs/readme.md/readme-color-text.png)

### Fonts

**Lato (Headers):**
![Font color image](/docs/readme.md/readme-text-lato.png)
Lato as the primary font for headers, titles, and navigation elements in our e-commerce project. This modern and elegant sans-serif font offers versatility and a clean design, making it an ideal choice for highlighting essential information. Lato not only exudes professionalism but also adds a touch of style to our website's visual identity.

**Poppins (Text Paragraphs):**
![Font color image](/docs/readme.md/readme-text-poppins.png)
For text paragraphs, product descriptions, and other textual content, we've opted for Poppins. This sans-serif font is recognized for its exceptional readability and clarity, ensuring that our textual content is easily legible and visually engaging. Poppins contributes to a clean and modern appearance that aligns perfectly with our commitment to providing a seamless user experience.

# Deployment

### App Deployment
For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:**
   - Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Version Control
To manage version control and push code to the main repository on GitHub using GitPod, follow these steps:

 **Add Changes:**
   - In the GitPod terminal, use the command `git add .` to stage changes.

 **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit changes with a descriptive comment using the command:
     ```
     git commit -m "Push comment here"
     ```

 **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the updates to the repository on GitHub with the command:
     ```
     git push
     ```


 **Migrate Models:**
    - In the terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Forking the Repository:

By forking the GitHub Repository, can create a copy of the original repository without affecting the original. Follow these steps:

 **GitHub Account Setup:**
   - Log into GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.
